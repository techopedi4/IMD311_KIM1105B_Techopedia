    <h1 style="font-size:30px">Acer Nitro 5</h1>
    <h1 style="font-size:20px">Average Price: RM2,629.00</h1>
    <div class="content" style="height:0px;"></div>

    <center><img src="images/acern.jpg" alt="PC" width="380" height="300"></center>
    <center><p>The matte black plastic surfaces make the Nitro 5 appear quite subdued. 
      However, thanks to its angular design, it does not look boring at all. The 
      build quality is on a good level, and the input devices are usable. 
      The selection of ports is not outstanding but it is good enough for a 
      laptop in this price bracket. The Nitro 5 does not offer any premium features.</p></center>
    <br><br><br>

    <h2 style="font-size:30px">Toshiba Z30C</h2>
    <h2 style="font-size:20px">Average Price: RM1,459.00</h2>
    <div class="content" style="height:0px;"></div>
    <center><img src="images/toshiz30.jpg" alt="PC" width="380" height="300"></center>
    <center><p>Toshiba Z30 is an extremely lightweight premium-range subnotebook for 
      the business world. On the counter will get business-suitable connectivity 
      (LTE, docking) and the best security features including TPM and fingerprint scanner. It might seem that 
      Toshiba doesn't miss out on anything when looking at the Core i7-6500U and the 512 GB SSD.</p></center>
    <br><br><br>

    <h3 style="font-size:30px">Acer Spin 3</h3>
    <h3 style="font-size:20px">Average Price: RM2,200.00</h3>
    <div class="content" style="height:0px;"></div>
    <center><img src="images/acer3.jpg" alt="PC" width="380" height="300"></center>
    <center><p>With the Spin 3 SP314, Acer manages to squeeze the best possible performance out from the built-in hardware in many aspects. 
      This is confirmed by the various benchmarks in our test, in which the device mostly delivered above-average results.</p></center>
    <br><br><br>

    <h4 style="font-size:30px">Dell Latitude E6420</h3>
    <h3 style="font-size:20px">Average Price: RM1,999.00</h3>
    <div class="content" style="height:0px;"></div>
    <center><img src="images/delle6.jpg" alt="PC" width="380" height="300"></center>
    <p>The placement of the ports is quite convenient, most ports relegated to the far corners of the case.  
      The variety of ports on the E6420, however, still leaves some things to be desired: the combination 
      headphone/microphone port is not compatible with most existing headsets (separate connectors), a USB 3.0 adapter can optionally be built in to 
      replace the DVD drive (or attached via ExpressCard adapter).  And for attaching an external monitor there's only one way to go, HDMI.</p>

    <h2>HP ProBook 430 G7</h2>
    <h5>Average Price: RM2,699.00</h5>
    <div class="content" style="height:0px;">Image</div>
    <img src="images/hp430.jpeg" alt="PC" width="380" height="300">
    <p>The basic verdict of the HP ProBook 430 G7 holds true. The comparably affordable office laptop has 
      many positives on its side: The comfortable keyboard, the extremely good upgradability or the SD card reader. 
      All of these points should be enough to make the ProBook into an ideal companion device for many students or 
      self-employed users.
      The internal changes are at the same time both positive and negative. 
      Wi-Fi 6 is with no doubt a great improvement. The newer Comet Lake processor on the other hand 
      does not manage to outperform the older Whiskey Lake predecessor. Despite the performance stagnation, 
      the ProBook runs warmer than the older model and is less enduring when it comes to the battery life. 
      Those are not bad enough to be outright negatives, but they also are not really positive aspects. There are 
      other new problems: The pulsating fan and the DPC latency problem. Apart from those, the negatives of 
      the old model remain: The screen has a weak color gamut coverage, Thunderbolt and business features are missing 
      and there is no pointing-stick.</p>

    <h2>Dell Latitude E7240</h2>
    <h5>Average Price: RM1,299.00</h5>
    <div class="content" style="height:0px;">Image</div>
    <img src="images/dell.jpg" alt="PC" width="380" height="300">
    <p>Dell created a solid and decent business ultrabook with the Latitude E7240. It is light and delivers a good system performance. 
      Several components can be replaced and it comes with many important business features including a docking port. Also the good keyboard 
      with built-in backlight, the nearly ideal 
      interface layout, and the long warranty period of 36 months compensate this a little bit. </p>

    <h2>Toshiba satellite r830-11C Notebook</h2>
    <h5>Average Price: RM4956.95</h5>
    <div class="content" style="height:0px;">Image</div>
    <img src="images/toshir30.jpg" alt="PC" width="380" height="300">
    <p>The Toshiba Satellite R830 is a very capable subnotebook for users who 
      need to travel a lot with their work notebook, and donâ€™t want to carry too much weight. 
      From its appearance you could easily imagine the notebook in an office environment or at a meeting, 
      but it would also make a good impression at a presentation.
      In terms of performance too, the notebook will not let the user 
      down in any of these scenarios. Those who expect only the highest level of 
      performance from their notebook should look elsewhere; if the Satellite R830 is 
      running at full load for any real length of time, the processor will begin to throttle.</p>

    <h2>HP Elitebook Folio 9470M</h2>
    <h5>Average Price: RM1,299.00</h5>
    <div class="content" style="height:0px;">Image</div>
    <img src="images/hp94.jpeg" alt="PC" width="380" height="300">
    <p>The EliteBook can stand out from the crowd with numerous ports: a SmartCard reader, docking port, 
      battery-slice port and DisplayPort next to VGA are the highlights. Unfortunately the 3G-modem does not come as 
      standard, our review sample only has the preparation (antennas, SIM card slot, mini PCI Express slot). Maintenance and 
      replacement of components is unrivaled for ultrabooks. The battery can be removed and the empty mSATA slot can be upgraded with a 
      second SSD. The fan can be cleaned easily. Only the bigger and heavier Latitude E6430s with Expresscard34 and eSATA can 
      surpass this port variety.</p>
